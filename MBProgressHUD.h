/** 
 * Displays a simple HUD window containing a progress indicator and two optional labels for short messages.
 *
 * This is a simple drop-in class for displaying a progress HUD view similar to Apples private UIProgressHUD class.
 * The MBProgressHUD window spans over the entire space given to it by the initWithFrame constructor and catches all
 * user input on this region, thereby preventing the user operations on components below the view. The HUD itself is
 * drawn centered as a rounded semi-transparent view witch resizes depending on the user specified content.
 *
 * This view supports three modes of operation:
 * - MBProgressHUDModeIndeterminate - shows a UIActivityIndicatorView
 * - MBProgressHUDModeDeterminate - shows a custom round progress indicator (MBRoundProgressView)
 * - MBProgressHUDModeCustomView - shows an arbitrary, user specified view (@see customView)
 *
 * All three modes can have optional labels assigned:
 * - If the labelText property is set and non-empty then a label containing the provided content is placed below the
 *   indicator view.
 * - If also the detailsLabelText property is set then another label is placed below the first label.
