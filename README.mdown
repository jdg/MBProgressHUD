MBProgressHUD
=============

MBProgressHUD is an iOS drop-in class that displays a translucent HUD with an indicator and/or labels while work is being done in a background thread. The HUD is meant as a replacement for the undocumented, private UIKit UIProgressHUD with some additional features.

Requirements
============

MBProgressHUD works on any iOS version and is compatible with both ARC and non-ARC projects. It depends on the following Apple frameworks:

* Foundation.framework
* UIKit.framework
* CoreGraphics.framework

You will need LLVM 3.0 or later in order to build MBProgressHUD. 

Adding MBProgressHUD to your project
====================================

The simplest way to add the MBProgressHUD to your project is to directly add the `MBProgressHUD.h` and `MBProgressHUD.m` source files to your project.

1. Download the latest code version from the repository (you can simply use the Download Source button and get the zip or tar archive of the master branch).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `MBProgressHUD.h` and `MBProgressHUD.m` to your classes group (in the Groups & Files view). 
4. Make sure to select Copy items when asked. 

If you have a git tracked project, you can add MBProgressHUD as a submodule to your project. 

1. Move inside your git tracked project.
2. Add MBProgressHUD as a submodule using `git submodule add git://github.com/matej/MBProgressHUD.git MBProgressHUD` .
3. Open your project in Xcode, than drag and drop `MBProgressHUD.h` and `MBProgressHUD.m` to your classes group (in the Groups & Files view). 
4. Don't select Copy items and select a suitable Reference type (relative to project should work fine most of the time). 

You can also add MBProgressHUD as a static library to your workspace. See [this article](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/04/04/using-open-source-static-libraries-in-xcode-4/#using_a_static_library) for details. 

Usage
=====

The main guideline you need to follow when dealing with MBProgressHUD while running long-running tasks is keeping the main thread work-free, so the UI can be updated promptly. The recommended way of using MBProgressHUD is therefore to set it up on the main thread and then spinning the task, that you want to perform, off onto a new thread. 

```objective-c
[MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue( DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW, 0), ^{
	// Do something...
	dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
		[MBProgressHUD hideHUDForView:self.view animated:YES];
	});
});
```

If you need to configure the HUD you can do this by using the MBProgressHUD reference that showHUDAddedTo:animated: returns. 

```objective-c
MBProgressHUD *hud = [MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];
hud.mode = MBProgressHUDModeAnnularDeterminate;
hud.labelText = @"Loading";
[self doSomethingInBackgroundWithProgressCallback:^(float progress) {
	hud.progress = progress;
} completionCallback:^{
	[MBProgressHUD hideHUDForView:self.view animated:YES];
}];
```

UI updates should always be done on the main thread. Some MBProgressHUD setters are hoverer considered "thread safe" and can be called from background threads. Those also include `setMode:`, `setCustomView:`, `setLabelText:`, `setLabelFont:`, `setDetailsLabelText:`, `setDetailsLabelFont:` and `setProgress:`.

If you need to run your long-running task in the main thread, you should perform it with a slight delay, so UIKit will have enough time to update the UI (i.e., draw the HUD) before you block the main thread with your task.

```objective-c
[MBProgressHUD showHUDAddedTo:self.view animated:YES];
dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, 0.01 * NSEC_PER_SEC);
dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
	// Do something...
	[MBProgressHUD hideHUDForView:self.view animated:YES];
});
```

You should be aware that any HUD updates issued inside the above block won't be displayed until the block completes.

For more examples, including how to use MBProgressHUD with asynchronous operations such as NSURLConnection, take a look at the bundled demo project. Extensive API documentation is provided in the header file (MBProgressHUD.h).
